 # ✅ Clone Scripts Updated for GitHub Repository Names

**Date:** 2025-10-07

---

## 🔄 What Was Changed

Your GitHub repositories follow this naming pattern:
- `FitNEase-Auth-Service` (not `fitnease-auth`)
- `FitNEase-Client` (not `fitnease-client`)
- etc.

**Updated both clone scripts to match your actual GitHub repo names!**

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. clone-services.sh (Mac/Linux)
**OLD:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USER/fitnease-auth.git
```

**NEW:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USER/FitNEase-Auth-Service.git fitnease-auth
```

**Why the extra name?**
- `FitNEase-Auth-Service.git` - GitHub repo name
- `fitnease-auth` - Local folder name (lowercase, matches docker-compose.yml)

---

### 2. clone-services.bat (Windows)
**OLD:**
```batch
git clone https://github.com/%GITHUB_USER%/fitnease-auth.git
```

**NEW:**
```batch
git clone https://github.com/%GITHUB_USER%/FitNEase-Auth-Service.git fitnease-auth
```

Same logic - clones from capitalized GitHub repo, saves as lowercase folder.

## 🎯 Your GitHub Repository Names (Based on Pattern)

| Service | GitHub Repo Name | Local Folder Name |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Auth | `FitNEase-Auth-Service` | `fitnease-auth` |
| Communication | `FitNEase-Communication-Service` | `fitnease-comms` |
| Content | `FitNEase-Content-Service` | `fitnease-content` |
| Engagement | `FitNEase-Engagement-Service` | `fitnease-engagement` |
| Media | `FitNEase-Media-Service` | `fitnease-media` |
| ML | `FitNEase-ML-Service` | `fitnease-ml` |
| Operations | `FitNEase-Operations-Service` | `fitnease-operations` |
| Planning | `FitNEase-Planning-Service` | `fitnease-planning` |
| Social | `FitNEase-Social-Service` | `fitnease-social` |
| Tracking | `FitNEase-Tracking-Service` | `fitnease-tracking` |
| Client | `FitNEase-Client` | `fitnease-client` |

## ⚠️ About .gitignore

**Question:** Do we need to update .gitignore?

**Answer:** NO! ✅

**.gitignore ignores LOCAL folder names**, not GitHub repo names:

```gitignore
# This is correct - matches local folder names
fitnease-auth/
fitnease-social/
fitnease-client/
```

After clone script runs:
```
FitNEase-Setup/
├── fitnease-auth/         ← Local folder (lowercase)
├── fitnease-social/       ← Local folder (lowercase)
└── fitnease-client/       ← Local folder (lowercase)
```

Git ignores based on these **local folder names**, not GitHub repo names.

So .gitignore is **already correct!** ✅

## 🔍 How Git Clone Naming Works

```bash
# Clone with custom folder name:
git clone https://github.com/USER/RepoName.git custom-folder-name
              └─────────────────┬──────────────┘  └────────┬──────────┘
                         GitHub repo name              Local folder name
```

**Example:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheMeowgician/FitNEase-Auth-Service.git fitnease-auth
```

**Result:**
- Clones from: `FitNEase-Auth-Service` (GitHub)
- Saves as: `fitnease-auth/` (local folder)

---

## ✅ What This Fixes

### Before Update (WRONG):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheMeowgician/fitnease-auth.git
```
**Result:** ❌ ERROR - Repository not found!
(Because your actual repo is named `FitNEase-Auth-Service`)

### After Update (CORRECT):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheMeowgician/FitNEase-Auth-Service.git fitnease-auth
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS - Clones correctly as `fitnease-auth/`

---

## 🧪 How to Test

Run the clone script to test:

```bash
cd C:\Users\gabsm\Desktop\FitNEase-Setup

# Test on Windows
clone-services.bat

# OR on Mac/Linux
./clone-services.sh
```

**Expected Result:**
```
Cloning backend services...
Cloning into 'fitnease-auth'...
Cloning into 'fitnease-comms'...
Cloning into 'fitnease-content'...
... (all services clone successfully)
```

## 📋 Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub:

- [x] Updated clone-services.sh
- [x] Updated clone-services.bat
- [x] Verified .gitignore is correct (already was!)
- [ ] Test clone script works
- [ ] Push updated scripts to GitHub

---

## 🎉 Summary

**What changed:**
- ✅ Both clone scripts now use correct GitHub repo names
- ✅ Scripts rename folders to lowercase after cloning
- ✅ .gitignore already correct (uses local names)

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Groupmates can now actually clone services
- ✅ Folder names match docker-compose.yml expectations
- ✅ Everything works seamlessly

**Ready to push!** 🚀

## 💡 Pro Tip

If your GitHub repos have different names than assumed, just edit the clone scripts:

**Pattern:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/USER/GitHub-Repo-Name.git local-folder-name
```

**Current mapping:**
```bash
git clone .../FitNEase-Auth-Service.git fitnease-auth
git clone .../FitNEase-Communication-Service.git fitnease-comms
# etc.
```

Just make sure **local folder names** match what's in:
1. docker-compose.yml (service volumes)
2. .gitignore (folder names)
