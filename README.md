‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clone-services.sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clone-services.bat
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example
```

---

### STEP 2: Clone All Services (5-10 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Make sure you're in the FitNEase-Setup folder first!**

Check your current directory:
```bash
pwd    # Mac/Linux
cd     # Windows
```

You should see: `.../FitNEase-Setup`

If not, navigate to it:
```bash
cd FitNEase-Setup    # If you're one level up
```

**Now run the clone script:**

**Windows:**
```bash
clone-services.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x clone-services.sh
./clone-services.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Clones all 10 backend services
- Clones the mobile app
- Takes 5-10 minutes depending on internet speed

**Wait for it to complete!** You should see:
```
‚úÖ All services cloned successfully!
```

**After completion, you should see:**
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fitnease-auth/          ‚Üê NEW!
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fitnease-social/        ‚Üê NEW!
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fitnease-tracking/      ‚Üê NEW!
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (8 more services)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fitnease-client/        ‚Üê NEW!
```

---

### STEP 3: Setup Environment Variables (5 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: You should still be in the FitNEase-Setup folder**

Check your current directory:
```bash
pwd    # Mac/Linux - should show .../FitNEase-Setup
cd     # Windows - should show ...\FitNEase-Setup
```

**Now create and edit the .env file:**

**Windows:**
```bash
copy .env.example .env
notepad .env
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

**Edit the .env file and change these values:**

Find these lines and replace `CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD` with your own passwords:

```env
# CHANGE THESE!
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
ML_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

**Example:**
```env
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword123
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword123
ML_SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey456
```

**Save and close the file.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Use simple passwords for local testing (no special characters that might cause issues)

Check your current directory:
```bash
pwd    # Mac/Linux - should show .../FitNEase-Setup
cd     # Windows - should show ...\FitNEase-Setup
```

If you're not in FitNEase-Setup, navigate to it:
```bash
cd FitNEase-Setup
```

**Now start all services:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This takes 5-10 minutes the first time.

**What this does:**
- Builds and starts 10 backend services
- Starts 10 databases
- Starts Redis cache
- Starts API Gateway

**First time will take 10-15 minutes** to download and build everything.

**Wait until you see:**
```
‚úÖ All services started successfully
```

**Check status:**
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

All services should show "Up" or "healthy" status.

---

### STEP 6: Wait for Services to Initialize (2 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: You should still be in the FitNEase-Setup folder**

Services need time to start up completely.

**Wait 2-3 minutes**, then check logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop viewing logs.

---

### STEP 7: Run Database Migrations (5 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: You should still be in the FitNEase-Setup folder**

Run these commands one by one:

```bash
docker-compose exec fitnease-auth php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-social php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-tracking php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-content php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-engagement php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-media php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-operations php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-planning php artisan migrate --force
```

**Each command should show:**
```
Migration table created successfully.
Migrating: ...
Migrated: ...
```

---

### STEP 8: Start Mobile App (5 minutes)

**Open a NEW terminal window** (keep the other one open)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Check where you are first!**

```bash
pwd    # Mac/Linux
cd     # Windows
```

**Navigate to the mobile app folder:**

**If you're in FitNEase-Setup folder:**
```bash
cd fitnease-client
```

**If you're starting from Desktop or another location:**
```bash
# Windows example:
cd Desktop\FitNEase-Setup\fitnease-client

# Mac/Linux example:
cd Desktop/FitNEase-Setup/fitnease-client
```

**Verify you're in the right place** - you should see:
```bash
pwd    # Should show: .../FitNEase-Setup/fitnease-client
```

**Now install and start:**
```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Docker daemon is not running"
**Solution:**
- Open Docker Desktop application
- Wait until it says "Running"
- Try command again

---

### Problem: "Port already in use"
**Solution:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure you're in the FitNEase-Setup folder first!**

```bash
# Navigate to FitNEase-Setup folder
cd FitNEase-Setup    # Adjust path if needed

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Wait 10 seconds

# Start again
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### Problem: "Cannot connect to backend from mobile app"
**Solution:**

**Find your computer's IP address:**

**Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

**Mac:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet "
```
Look for 192.168.x.x

**Update API configuration:**

Navigate to the client folder and open the config file:
```bash
# From FitNEase-Setup folder:
cd fitnease-client

# Open the file with your editor (choose one):
notepad config/api.config.ts    # Windows
nano config/api.config.ts        # Mac/Linux
```

Change `localhost` to your IP address:
```typescript
// Change from:
baseURL: 'http://localhost:8090/auth'

// To:
baseURL: 'http://192.168.1.100:8090/auth'
```

Do this for all services in the config file.

Then restart Expo (make sure you're in fitnease-client folder):
```bash
pwd    # Should show: .../FitNEase-Setup/fitnease-client

npx expo start --clear
```

---

### Problem: Services won't start / Out of memory
**Solution:**
1. Close all other applications
2. Increase Docker memory:
   - Docker Desktop ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources
   - Set Memory to 6GB or higher
   - Click "Apply & Restart"
3. Try again

---

### Problem: "migration" command fails
**Solution:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure you're in the FitNEase-Setup folder first!**

```bash
# Navigate to FitNEase-Setup folder
cd FitNEase-Setup    # Adjust path if needed

# Check if service is running
docker-compose ps

# If service is not healthy, check logs
docker-compose logs fitnease-auth

# Wait 2-3 minutes and try again
```

---

### Problem: Expo QR code won't scan
**Solution:**
1. Make sure phone and laptop are on SAME WiFi
2. Try connection type:
   - Press `s` in terminal (switch to Expo Go)
   - Press `w` for web version (opens in browser)

---

### Problem: App shows blank screen
**Solution:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure you're in the fitnease-client folder!**

```bash
# Navigate to fitnease-client folder
cd FitNEase-Setup/fitnease-client    # Adjust path if needed

# Verify you're in the right place
pwd    # Should show: .../FitNEase-Setup/fitnease-client

# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```
