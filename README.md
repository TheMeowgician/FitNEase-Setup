## üéØ Step-by-Step Setup

### STEP 1: Clone the Setup Repository (2 minutes)

Open terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux):

```bash
# Go to your desktop or projects folder
cd Desktop

# Clone the setup repository
git clone https://github.com/TheMeowgician/FitNEase-Setup.git

# Go into the folder
cd FitNEase-Setup
```

**What you should see:**
```
FitNEase-Setup/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clone-services.sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clone-services.bat
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example
```

---

### STEP 2: Clone All Services (5-10 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Make sure you're in the FitNEase-Setup folder first!**

Check your current directory:
```bash
pwd    # Mac/Linux
cd     # Windows
```

You should see: `.../FitNEase-Setup`

If not, navigate to it:
```bash
cd FitNEase-Setup    # If you're one level up
```

**Now run the clone script:**

**Windows:**
```bash
clone-services.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x clone-services.sh
./clone-services.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Clones all 10 backend services
- Clones the mobile app
- Takes 5-10 minutes depending on internet speed

**Wait for it to complete!** You should see:
```
‚úÖ All services cloned successfully!
```

**After completion, you should see:**
```
FitNEase-Setup/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fitnease-auth/          ‚Üê NEW!
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fitnease-social/        ‚Üê NEW!
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fitnease-tracking/      ‚Üê NEW!
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (8 more services)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fitnease-client/        ‚Üê NEW!
```

---

### STEP 3: Setup Environment Variables (5 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: You should still be in the FitNEase-Setup folder**

Check your current directory:
```bash
pwd    # Mac/Linux - should show .../FitNEase-Setup
cd     # Windows - should show ...\FitNEase-Setup
```

**Now create and edit the .env file:**

**Windows:**
```bash
copy .env.example .env
notepad .env
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

**Edit the .env file and change these values:**

Find these lines and replace `CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD` with your own passwords:

```env
# CHANGE THESE!
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
ML_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

**Example:**
```env
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword123
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword123
ML_SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey456
```

**Save and close the file.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Use simple passwords for local testing (no special characters that might cause issues)

---

### STEP 3.5: Configure Service Settings (Optional - 5 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Some services need personalized configuration to work properly on your machine.

**First, create .env files for the services that need configuration:**

**A. Configure Email Settings (Auth & Communications Services)**

The auth and communications services need email configuration for sending verification emails and notifications.

**Configure fitnease-auth:**
```bash
cd fitnease-auth

# Create .env file from template
cp .env.example .env   # Mac/Linux
# OR
copy .env.example .env  # Windows
```

Open `.env` and update email settings:

**Windows:**
```bash
notepad .env
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
nano .env
```

Find and update:
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD="your_app_password_here"
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="FitNEase"
```

Save and go back:
```bash
cd ..
```

**Configure fitnease-comms (same email settings):**
```bash
cd fitnease-comms

# Create .env file from template
cp .env.example .env   # Mac/Linux
# OR
copy .env.example .env  # Windows
```

Open `.env` and update the same email settings as above, then:
```bash
cd ..
```

**How to get Gmail App Password:**
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
4. Generate a new app password for "FitNEase"
5. Copy the 16-character password and use it in `MAIL_PASSWORD`

---

**B. Configure ML Service (Important for ML features)**

The ML service has hardcoded IP addresses that need to match your computer's IP.

```bash
cd fitnease-ml

# Create .env file from template
cp .env.example .env   # Mac/Linux
# OR
copy .env.example .env  # Windows
```

Open `.env`:

**Windows:**
```bash
notepad .env
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
nano .env
```

Find your computer's IP address first:
- **Windows:** Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt, look for "IPv4 Address"
- **Mac:** Run `ifconfig | grep "inet "` in Terminal

Update these lines with YOUR IP address:
```env
# Replace 192.168.1.5 with YOUR IP address
LARAVEL_AUTH_URL=http://YOUR_IP_HERE:8000
LARAVEL_CONTENT_URL=http://YOUR_IP_HERE:8002
LARAVEL_TRACKING_URL=http://YOUR_IP_HERE:8007
LARAVEL_PLANNING_URL=http://YOUR_IP_HERE:8005
LARAVEL_ENGAGEMENT_URL=http://YOUR_IP_HERE:8003
```

Example:
```env
LARAVEL_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.1.10:8000
LARAVEL_CONTENT_URL=http://192.168.1.10:8002
# ... etc
```

Save and go back:
```bash
cd ..
```

---

üí° **Note:**
- **Other services don't need manual .env configuration** - they work with default settings from .env.example (which gets used automatically by Docker)
- If you skip these configurations:
  - Email verification/notifications won't work (but registration still works)
  - ML service might not connect to other services properly

Make sure you're back in the FitNEase-Setup folder before continuing:
```bash
pwd    # Should show: .../FitNEase-Setup
```

---

### STEP 4: Start Docker Desktop (1 minute)

1. Open **Docker Desktop** application
2. Wait until it says "Docker Desktop is running"
3. Keep it running in the background

---

### STEP 5: Start Backend Services (10 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Make sure you're in the FitNEase-Setup folder**

Check your current directory:
```bash
pwd    # Mac/Linux - should show .../FitNEase-Setup
cd     # Windows - should show ...\FitNEase-Setup
```

If you're not in FitNEase-Setup, navigate to it:
```bash
cd FitNEase-Setup
```

**Now start all services:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This takes 5-10 minutes the first time.

**What this does:**
- Builds and starts 10 backend services
- Starts 10 databases
- Starts Redis cache
- Starts API Gateway

**First time will take 10-15 minutes** to download and build everything.

**Wait until you see:**
```
‚úÖ All services started successfully
```

**Check status:**
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

All services should show "Up" or "healthy" status.

---

### STEP 6: Wait for Services to Initialize (2 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: You should still be in the FitNEase-Setup folder**

Services need time to start up completely.

**Wait 2-3 minutes**, then check logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop viewing logs.

---

### STEP 7: Install Dependencies and Run Migrations (10 minutes)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: You should still be in the FitNEase-Setup folder**

**First, install Composer dependencies for Laravel services:**

Run these commands one by one:

```bash
docker-compose exec fitnease-auth composer install

docker-compose exec fitnease-social composer install

docker-compose exec fitnease-tracking composer install

docker-compose exec fitnease-content composer install

docker-compose exec fitnease-comms composer install

docker-compose exec fitnease-engagement composer install

docker-compose exec fitnease-media composer install

docker-compose exec fitnease-operations composer install

docker-compose exec fitnease-planning composer install
```

**Note:** fitnease-ml is a Python Flask service and doesn't need composer install (Python dependencies are installed automatically when the container starts)

**Wait for all composer installs to complete (each takes 30-60 seconds)**

**Then run database migrations for Laravel services:**

```bash
docker-compose exec fitnease-auth php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-social php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-tracking php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-content php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-comms php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-engagement php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-media php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-operations php artisan migrate --force

docker-compose exec fitnease-planning php artisan migrate --force
```

**Each migration command should show:**
```
Migration table created successfully.
Migrating: ...
Migrated: ...
```

---

### STEP 8: Start Mobile App (5 minutes)

**Open a NEW terminal window** (keep the other one open)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Check where you are first!**

```bash
pwd    # Mac/Linux
cd     # Windows
```

**Navigate to the mobile app folder:**

**If you're in FitNEase-Setup folder:**
```bash
cd fitnease-client
```

**If you're starting from Desktop or another location:**
```bash
# Windows example:
cd Desktop\FitNEase-Setup\fitnease-client

# Mac/Linux example:
cd Desktop/FitNEase-Setup/fitnease-client
```

**Verify you're in the right place** - you should see:
```bash
pwd    # Should show: .../FitNEase-Setup/fitnease-client
```

**Now install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

**IMPORTANT: Configure your IP address before starting Expo!**

Open the file: `config/api.config.ts`

**Windows:**
```bash
notepad config\api.config.ts
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
nano config/api.config.ts
```

**Update the configuration:**

1. Find your computer's IP address first:
   - **Windows:** Open Command Prompt, run `ipconfig`, look for "IPv4 Address"
   - **Mac:** Open Terminal, run `ifconfig | grep "inet "`, look for 192.168.x.x

2. In the `api.config.ts` file:
   ```typescript
   // Change ACTIVE_MEMBER to your name
   const ACTIVE_MEMBER = 'Gab'; // Change to: 'Gab', 'Wimari', 'Nhiko', or 'Chrystian'

   // Update your IP in TEAM_IPS
   const TEAM_IPS = {
     Gab: '192.168.1.5',              // ‚Üê Replace with your actual IP
     Wimari: 'CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_IP',
     Nhiko: 'CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_IP',
     Chrystian: 'CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_IP',
   };
   ```

3. Save the file and close the editor

**Now start Expo:**
```bash
npx expo start
```

**Wait for QR code to appear.**

---

### STEP 9: Open App on Your Phone (2 minutes)

1. Open **Expo Go** app on your phone
2. **Make sure your phone and laptop are on the SAME WiFi network**
3. Scan the QR code from terminal

**Android:** Use Expo Go's built-in QR scanner

**iPhone:**
